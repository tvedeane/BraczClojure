# bracz-clojure

Are you using Raczynski's library to borrow books? BraczSearch is a decorator of it's catalog search available [here](http://www.bracz.edu.pl). I found original page quite hard to use and this is why I decided to create this app. This is another time I'm writing this code, but this time I'm doing it in Clojure.
